# Web Development Intern - Afame Technologies

This repository will contain the 2 front-end projects required during the web development internship period.

The projects will cover various aspects of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project will focus on different concepts and techniques, allowing me to gain a comprehensive understanding of front-end development.

Throughout the internship, I will be working closely with the development team at Afame Technologies, receiving guidance and feedback to enhance my skills. I am excited about this opportunity to learn and contribute to real-world projects.

Feel free to explore the repository and provide any suggestions or feedback. I look forward to showcasing my progress and growth as a web developer during this internship.
